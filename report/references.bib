               infrastructure resilience, creating the need for a unifying
               framework for assessing the resilience of critical

               Resilience has been defined and applied in many disciplines;
               consequently, many disparate approaches exist. We propose a
               general framework for assessing the resilience of infrastructure
               and economic systems. The framework consists of three primary
               components: (1) a definition of resilience that is specific to
               infrastructure systems; (2) a quantitative model for measuring
               the resilience of systems to disruptive events through the
               evaluation of both impacts to system performance and the cost of
               recovery; and (3) a qualitative method for assessing the system
               properties that inherently determine system resilience,
               providing insight and direction for potential improvements in
               these systems.",

              aspects of neighborhood life. The ability of neighborhoods to
              function as service providers is a critical and understudied
              aspect of neighborhood research. This paper offers a
              methodological contribution of the analysis of neighborhoods as
              service providers. Provision of services is defined in terms of
              accessibility, or the spatial proximities between residents and
              the facilities. Because the focus is on neighborhoods, access is
              defined on the basis of the pedestrian rather than the
              automobile. In addition, the needs of the neighborhood population
              are considered. A case study of Portland, Oregon, is used to
              demonstrate how an evaluation of pedestrian access could be
              conducted at the neighborhood scale.",
